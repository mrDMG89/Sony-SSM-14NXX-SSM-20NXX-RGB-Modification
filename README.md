## Overview
The purpose of this document is to explain how to modify a Sony SSM monitor to be able to support RGB. As a disclaimer, I am not an electronics engineer by any means, and all of the information contained within is collated from various sources online. This documentation is mostly for my own reference, but I do hope others find it useful too. While I have done this modification myself, I was standing on the shoulders of others the whole way.

Please note that there are actually multiple ways to achieve this mod, and that the more correct way is almost definitely to populate *all* missing components, but this documentation serves to outline the specific route that I took to achieve it.

## Who this guide is for
This guide is specifically for you if you own any of the following monitors, and wish to modify them to accept RGB:
|14" Models|20" Models|
|----------|----------|
|SSM-14N5A|SSM-20N5A|
|SSM-14N5E|SSM-20N5E|
|SSM-14N5U|SSM-20N5U|

### PVM models
This guide may also be useful to you if you own any of the monitors from the table below, as they are also based on the same chassis as the aforementioned 'SSM-XXXXX' monitors.

|14" Models|20" Models|
|----------|----------|
|PVM-14N5A|PVM-20N5A|
|PVM-14N5E|PVM-20N5E|
|PVM-14N5MDE|--|
|PVM-14N5U|PVM-20N5U|
|PVM-14N6A|PVM-20N6A|
|PVM-14N6E|PVM-20N6E|
|PVM-14N6U|PVM-20N6U|

Modifying the PVM models is slightly different, and perhaps even easier depending on your perspective. The mod differences specific to PVM models that I am aware of are:

1. **Important** - Your PVM may or may not have a connector and wiring harness pre-installed at connector CN403 on the A board. If your monitor does not have this connector + harness, then you will need to route your own wires between the A and Q boards, but **be aware** that Sony made a mistake with the PCB labelling for this connector and it is reversed. On the PCB, the red pin is labelled as being closest to the front of the monitor, but the red pin is actually the one closest to the corner of the PCB; all other inputs are respectively reversed too. Therefore, from the corner of the PCB to the front, the pinouts are: R, GND, G, GND, B, GND, and Audio.

2. You may not need to make the same jumper cuts on the A board as noted in the instructions below, as they may already be absent.

3. The BA7604N and MC14052BCP ICs may already be present on your model, which means you will not need to add them.

## Tools List
### Required
* Screwdriver
* Soldering iron (I used a TS100)
* Desoldering braid / Desoldering tool
* Solder (I used 0.7mm)
* Insulated wire

### Highly Recommended
* Multimeter
* Flux
* Side cutters

## Step 1 - Dismantling the monitor
A note on safety: It goes without saying that working on CRTs has an element of risk as high voltages are involved. You can get a nasty zap or worse if you are not careful. There are lots of guides on YouTube on CRT safety and how to discharge them. I encourage you to educate yourself further on CRT safety so you're prepared for doing this mod.

At the high level, dismantling the monitor for this modification involves the following steps:
1. Removing the case
2. Removing the Q board (i.e. the panel + PCB with the connectors on it), and releasing the Q board from the connector mounting plate
4. Removing the A board (i.e. the main board that sits at the bottom of the monitor)

### Step 1.1 - Removing the case
1. Remove the 4 screws (2 per side) on the sides of the monitor.
2. Remove the 4 screws on the rear of the monitor, all of which are located near the bottom. Two on the outer perimeter of the case, and two on the connector panel.
3. Using the carry handles, pull the outer case off to the rear.

### Step 1.2 - Detaching the Q board and releasing the Q board from the connector mounting plate
1. Looking at the rear of the monitor, note that there are markings that suggest that you need to push down on the plastic frame below the input board.
2. Gently press down in the designated areas while pulling the Q board outward to release it.
3. This procedure is best illustrated in Steve @ Retro Tech's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=320&v=-ifKYeq9aC4).
4. Disconnect the ribbon cables and ground wires.
5. Using a soldering iron + desoldering braid, or a desoldering tool, desolder all of the points where the Q board attaches to the connector mounting plate. Note that this includes 4 ground tab sections on the perimeter of the board.

### Step 1.3 - Removing the A board
1. Take a note / photo of all the connector locations.
2. Discharge and remove the anode cap. An example of how to remove and discharge the anode cap for PVM's is illustrated and explained in Steve @ Retro Tech's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=184&v=AZBh8YaPbQg).
3. Disconnect the remaining connectors.
4. Hold the A board firmly at the back and pull it outwards. There are no screws or tabs holding it down.

## Step 2 - Q board and mounting panel modifications
Now that the Q board has been released from the mounting plate, you can add the required components. I did it by first adding the BNC connectors to the mounting plate and soldering wire into the solder cup terminals which I then fed through the appropriate holes in the Q board. I then used insulated wires on the BNC ground lugs that wrapped around and attached to a single ground terminal on the Q board / mounting plate.

Add component|75 ohm resistor|R1344|
Add component|75 ohm resistor|R1346|
Add component|75 ohm resistor|Tieing BNC pin directly to ANA-R at CN1303. You can attach to the emitter pin at Q1308|
Add component|75 ohm resistor|Tieing BNC pin directly to ANA-G at CN1303. You can attach to the emitter pin at Q1309|
Add component|75 ohm resistor|Tieing BNC pin directly to ANA-B at CN1303. You can attach to the emitter pin at Q1310|
Add component|Insulated wire|Tieing the Sync BNC pin to EXT SYNC at CN402 on A board|
Add component|Insulated wire|**Optional** - Tieing AUDIO at CN1303 to emitter pin at Q1305|

The optional jumper wire for the Audio means that the RGB and Line A will share the same 'Audio In' jack.

## Step 3 - A board modifications
Modifying the A board is pretty straight-forward. It's just a matter of removing and adding a few components. As noted earlier, some of these changes are not necessary if you are modifying the **non-SSM** variants based on the same chassis.

## Step 4 - Case / enclosure modifications
You will need to make some minor finishing touches to the case. Specifically:
1. Cutting holes in the rear panel plastic so the BNC connectors can poke through. One way you can do this is by using a scalpel to cut a rough but slightly smaller diameter circle out from behind and then roll up some 240 grit sandpaper and sand down the remaining overlap.
2. Cutting holes in the front panel plastic so you can reach the tactile buttons used for switching between your two inputs (Line A and RGB).
3. Adding labels for your new inputs and buttons.

### 3D-printed front panel buttons
For a small fee, I can 3D print and send you 2 buttons for switching between RGB and Line A that fit perfectly through the existing holes in the front panel of the monitor (the holes hidden behind the vinyl sticker). Note that you will still need to punch or cut a square hole in the vinyl sticker so the button can protrude through.

These buttons are a simple and elegant solution that remain captive in the hole and rest against the newly soldered-in switches.

If you are interested, you can drop me an email: oo2@outlook.com
The cost is $10 AUD + shipping for 2 buttons. I can also sand and paint them for you for an additional $5 AUD - I will paint them with three coats of Tamiya Acrylic.
